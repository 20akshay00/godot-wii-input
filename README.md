# GDWiiInput - WIP!

A scrappy attempt to wrap the functionality of [Wiiuse](https://github.com/wiiuse/wiiuse) that allows interfacing with the hardware of the [Wii remote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote) and its various accessories. I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing, but it seems to be working. Happy to have contributions from anyone else interested!
