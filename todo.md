- rumble w/ duration
- figure out if nunchuk connect/disconnect signal can be more robust
- [x] joystick deadzone handling, etc
- latency??
- acceloremeter (both nunchuk and wiimote)
- gyro (how to calibrate etc)
- led
- async connection
- handle wiimote disconnect

- IR?
- distinguish inputs from multiple wiimotes? (through device id which InputEvent strictly requires, so its already done!)
