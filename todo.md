- [x] rumble w/ duration (callbacks are bit wonky..)
- [x] led
- [x] joystick deadzone handling, etc

- figure out if nunchuk/wiimote connect/disconnect signal can be more robust
- acceloremeter (both nunchuk and wiimote)
- gyro (how to calibrate etc)
- async connection

- latency??
- IR?
- distinguish inputs from multiple wiimotes? (through device id which InputEvent strictly requires, so its already done!)
